## Specs

| Behavior | Input | Output |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| user inputs a number and the program replaces certain numbers | 5 | ["0", "Beep", "Boop", "Sorry (your name). I can't do that", "4", "5"] |
| a refresh button appears that you can press to try again | "Start Over" button is pushed | refresh's page |
